HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.

Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

## What's HTML Used For? 

HTML is the default language of websites and web-based documents. It helps a browser understand the structure and style of a document or files for viewing over the internet. It allows your web pages to host audio, videos, spreadsheets, and other applications. It also facilitates navigation within web pages or between websites through hypertext. 

Moreover, website makers can use HTML to design forms for ordering products, making reservations, or searching for information. HTML is, therefore, the basic building block for building your brand and running an e-commerce site or an online subscription-based business. 

## How Does HTML Work?

The website author types an HTML document that's saved with an extension .html or .htm (filename.html or filename.htm). This file is then uploaded to the Worldwide Web, which would show how it looks online. 

To open the HTML file from your PC, go to File Explorer, right-click the file (or double-click it if you're using Mac) and select "Open with" from the menu to launch in your preferred browser. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and other browsers can recognize and read this format. You can also launch your browser, press Ctrl+O to pull up the "open" menu, and double-click your html file. 

The browsers use the HTML elements to interpret the content of the page and render them correctly on the screen in a neat and formatted way.
